<ISSUES>
	Fixing Font problems 03-10-2019:
		as it turns out xorg-fonts causes the issue so unse noto-fonts instead
	
	Udev rules not applying:
		in void the default path for udev rules is /usr/lib/udev/rules.d
	
	U2f rules not working:
		install the pachage pam-u2f then navigate to the rules folder and check 
		70-u2f.rules for your specific key, if it is not present add it at the 
		bottom following the same format as the other keys
	
	"Unfixable" errors at startup:
		change the loglevel to 3 in the grub config file located at /etc/default/grub
