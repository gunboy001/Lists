Fixing Font problems 03-10-2019:
	as it turns out xorg-fonts causes the issue so unse noto-fonts instead

Udev rules not applying:
	in void the default path for udev rules is /usr/lib/udev/rules.d

U2f rules not working:
	install the pachage pam-u2f then navigate to the rules folder and check 
	70-u2f.rules for your specific key, if it is not present add it at the 
	bottom following the same format as the other keys

"Unfixable" errors at startup:
	change the loglevel to 3 in the grub config file located at /etc/default/grub
