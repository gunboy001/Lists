-Qt for wayland requires qt5-wayland package and "export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland"

-You still have tor and "arm" to monitor it

-Docker is pretty cool you should use it, https://www.kali.org/news/official-kali-linux-docker-images/
  also works with wifite2, it basically is a shell-oriented low-weight high-performance virtual machine
  wich can run prebuilt docker images or your personal docker images. Docs: https://docs.docker.com/

# ARCH SECTION

-Pacman commands:
  "pacman -Syy" update repositories
  "pacman -Su" update packages
  "pacman -Qdtq" list unused/orphan packages
  "pacman -R" remove a package
  "pacman -S" install a package
  "pacman -R $(pacman -Qdtq)" remove unused packages
  "pacman -Rns" remove packages and its dependencies (recursively)
  "pacman -Ql" list all package files and locations
  "pacman -Qqe" list all installed packages
  "pacman -Qc" view package changelog
  If you panic just do "sudo pacman -Syy" and then "sudo pacman -Su"
  "rm -rf /var/lib/pacman/db.lck" remove pacman's transaction lock file
    (to solve "could not unlock database" error)
  To manage and download packages from the AUR use:
    pikaur
    yaourt (unmantained)
  These are all wrappers which means they extend some functionalities of pacman to use
    AUR, for example updating and installing packages (-Syu and -S)
  NOTE: pacman wrappers don't need to be run as root since it's dangerous to
    run PKGBUILD as such.

# SYSADMIN SECTION

-"acpi" is kinda important in laptops "acpi -i" for info, also "thinkpad_acpi" should be noted

-GREP basics:
  G-REP or "grep" can be used to filter command results:
  "ps ax | grep whatyouwant" and it will output the line containing "whatyouwant"
   example "dmesg | grep whatyouwant"
  NOTE: "|" is used to pipe the output in another program

-Linux afterinstall (how to get thing working):
  Bluetooth usage:
    Refers to:
      https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluetooth_headset
      https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/bluetooth
    Start the "bluetooth.service" service then refer to:
  Generating locales (languages and language support):
    Add locales uncommenting them in /etc/locale.gen
    Run "locale-gen"
    Reboot
    NOTE: if installing locales with a specific character set (russian, chinese, japanese)
      it is needed to also install the specific fonts, refer to:
      "https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Localization" to find the specific font packages
      and install them using pacman
  Getting the graphics drivers:
    For Intel graphics cards:
      Refers to: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/intel_graphics
      mesa
      lib32-mesa
      vulkan-intel
    For nvidia graphics cards:
      Please refer to: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA#Installation
    For amd graphics cards:
      mesa
      lib32-mesa
      xf86-video-ati: for Xorg hardware acceleration support
      mesa-vdpau and lib32-mesa-vdpau: for accelerated video decoding

-You use "ps ax" to view all processes and their UIDs

-"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd" just helpful

-To run .jar files in cli you must use "java -jar"

-To list all partitions "sudo fdisk -l"

-To check a disk's health you need "smartmontools", first check system compatibility with "sudo smartctl -c /dev/sdX"
  then either do a short test "sudo smartctl -t short /dev/sdX" or a long test "sudo smartctl -t long /dev/sdX"
  lastly do "sudo smartctl -H /dev/sdX" to get the results

-Recompiling compilers for zerynth:
  If facing compiling errors in zerynth, manually recompile the compiler for the board in ""~/.zerynth2/sys"
  for example replacing the xtensa-lx106 compiler (esp8266) goes:
    1-Move the old compiler folder somewhere safe (~/.zerynth2/sys/xtensa-lx106)
    2-Clone and compile (as standalone) new compiler in a temporary folder, guide here -> "http://domoticx.com/sdk-esp8266-xtensa-architecture-toolchain/"
    3-Move the newly created compiler folder (xtensa-lx106-elf) in ~/.zerynth2/sys and rename it as the original one (xtensa-lx106/)
    4-Copy the old package.json in the new compiler folder
  Better yet is to wait for an official fix and report the bug on the troubleshooting section
  Also the same thing has to be done with the xtensa-lx6 compiler (esp32)
  "https://dl.espressif.com/doc/esp-idf/latest/get-started/linux-setup.html"

-Fixing Arduino permissions:
  Source: https://www.howtogeek.com/50787/add-a-user-to-a-group-or-second-group-on-linux/
  "ls -la /dev/tty*" and see which group TTYs are in, then add yourself to that group:
  "usermod -a -G examplegroup exampleusername" or just use "$USER" to add current user, then reboot.

-Theming gnome:
  download the theme packages at "https://www.gnome-look.org/" and unzip them
  then depending if it is an icon theme or an normal theme place them in
    "/usr/share/icons" or "/usr/share/themes" accordingly

-Adding executables and shortcuts:
  Refers to:
    https://askubuntu.com/questions/322772/how-do-i-add-an-executable-to-my-search-path
    https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3809/how-can-i-make-a-program-executable-from-everywhere
  You have to add them to your $PATH, example: "export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin"
  Quote "If you just type export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file> at the command line it will only last for the length of the session.
  If you want to change it permanently add export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file> to your ~/.bashrc file (just at the end is fine)."

-Use "clamav" as antivirus: "https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ClamAV", to update use "freshclam" as sudo
  and to scan "clamscan --recursive --infected /path/to/something"

-Some git stuff:
  Creating a repo and pushing the first commit: "https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/"
    basically it's a matter of defining the remote (origin) repo "git remote add origin <repo URL>"
    committing the changes in local repo "git commit -m "message" "
    pushing before first pull "git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories" the last part is just to merge the repos (if needed)
    and finally pushing the changes "git push origin master", or in atom just publish
  Using 2 factor auth. in command line and atom: "https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/"
    basically you have to use a access token instead of the password, these are unique and you can only
    see them once, so be careful with them!

-Powertop usage:
  Arch page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/powertop
  To start powertop use "sudo powertop"
  For the first calibration use "sudo powertop --calibrate", NOTE: it takes a few minutes and during
    that time the screen may go (it does) black for a few minutes too, just let it run.
  To set everything to "good" do "sudo powertop --auto-tune",
    to make the auto-tune start at boot refer to the Arch wiki or "how to create a sysemd service"
  NOTE: in order to apply changes and stuff you have to leave it running for some time to let it
    take its measures and stuff

-Power management:
  Arch page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management#Power_management_with_systemd
  To change the actions to take when power button or lid switch events occur:
    modify the conf. file at /etc/systemd/logind.conf or /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/*.conf

-Who are you? "whoami"

-Where am I? "groups"

-Adding executables not located in /bin/ (downloaded from internet):
  Refers to:
    https://askubuntu.com/questions/322772/how-do-i-add-an-executable-to-my-search-path
    https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3809/how-can-i-make-a-program-executable-from-everywhere
  Adding them momentarily:
    Add them to your $PATH, example: "export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin"
  Adding them at the start of the session:
      Using bashrc:
        Add export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file> (the bin/ folder) to your ~/.bashrc file (just at the end is fine)
      Using cron:
        Add export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file> to your crontab file:
          Open your crontab file using "crontab -e" for current user or "crontab -e -u username" fo others
          At the end of the file add "@reboot export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file>"
          NOTE: probably it is best do to add the command in the "su" cron file

-Checking system errors:
  Refers to:
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd#Journal
  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-journalctl-to-view-and-manipulate-systemd-logs
  If your distro users systemctl the easiest way to check errors is to look up the recent
    events in the system logs to do that type "journalctl"

-Windows:
  Adding programs to PATH:
    Source: https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/
    Open: Control panel -> system -> advanced system settings -> environment variables
    On windows 7 or 8:
      Set the variable name to "Path"
      Add the path to the program preceded by ";" ex. "...;C:\path\to\something"
    On windows 10:
      Click on "New"
      Enter the path to the program
  Retrieving the windows product key:
    Open a console with admin privileges
    Type "wmic path softwarelicensingservice get OA3xOriginalProductKey"

-Creating a systemd (systemctl) service (aka how to make a program start at boot):
  Guides and references:
  https://askubuntu.com/questions/112705/how-do-i-make-powertop-changes-permanent
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/powertop
  https://askubuntu.com/questions/919054/how-do-i-run-a-single-command-at-startup-using-systemd
  Create a file under /etc/systemd/system/ and call it <whatever>.service
  Then follow the formatting {
    [Unit]
    Description=PowerTOP auto tune

    [Service]
    Type=idle                                 # Not necessary
    Environment="TERM=dumb"                   # Not necessary
    ExecStart="PATHTOEXECUTABLE --OPTIONS"

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
  }
  And then enable it using "systemctl whatever.service enable"

# NETWORK SECTION

-Gathering information on network cards ie IP, MAC, status, etc.
  With ifconfig, just type "ifconfig" and it will give:
    ether: the MAC address
    inet: the network ip address
    netmatsk: the netmask duh
    inet6: the network ipv6
  With iwconfig (specifically for wireless cards), just type "iwconfig" and it will give:
    Mode: monitor or managed
    ESSID: the ESSID (name) of the connected network
    Frequency
    Access Point: the MAC address of the AP
    Signal level: the power/quality of the signal
    Among other informations
  Sites for public IP discovery and information gathering:
    https://www.iplocation.net/
    http://www.whatsmyip.org/

-Changing the MAC address:
  Using macchanger:
    The general usage is "macchanger [OPTIONS] interface", the most common options being
    -A for a random MAC,
    -r to reset to the original one,
    -a to change it to a random MAC of some type (same vendor),
    -b to set the "locally administered" bit set to false or
    -m XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX to manually set the MAC address.
  Using ifconfig:
    First disable the interface using "ifconfig <interface> down"
    Then change the MAC address using "ifconfig <interface> hw ether 00:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
      it has to begin with 00:*
    Then finally re-enable the interface with "ifconfig <interface> up"
  To prevent the MAC address from reverting to its original state you can configure the network manager
    to not scan for other networks using a random MAC address (that is done for security by many OSs and
    also by phones), to achieve this you have to change the conf. file for your network manager:
      For GNOME (kali) add {
        [device]
        wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=preserve

        [connection]
        ethernet.cloned-mac-address=preserve
        wifi.cloned-mac-address=preserve
      }
      to /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

-Changing interfaces to monitor mode:
  Not mandatory but best use is to first use "airmon-ng check kill", this kills all processes
    that could interfere with the process and later with the attacks
  Using airmon-ng:
    Simply use "airmon-ng start <interface>" to put it in monitor mode
    And "airmon-ng stop <interface>" to revert it to managed
  NOTE: when using airmon-ng it will change the interface name by adding *mon to its name
    for example wlan0 becomes wlan0mon
  Using iwconfig (useful since first method is not always reliable):
    Disable interface using "ifconfig <interface> down" or "ifdown <interface>"
    Change to minitor mode with "iwconfig <interface> mode monitor"
    Re-enable interface with "ifconfig <interface> up" or "ifup <interface>"
    To revert it back to managed disable the interface then do "iwconfig <interface> mode managed"
      then re-enable the interface

-Restarting network interfaces:
  Without ssh:
    Disable and re-enable the interface with "ifdown <interface>" and then "ifup <interface>"
      or "ifconfig <interface> down" and then "ifconfig <interface> up"
  On ssh:
    Non systemd "/etc/init.d/networking restart"
    Systemd (Arch) "systemctl restart NetworkManager"

-Enabling IP forwarding:
  Arch page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Internet_sharing_(Italiano)
  "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
  To revert it back:
    "echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
