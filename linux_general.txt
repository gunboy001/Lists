-Qt for wayland requires qt5-wayland package and "export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland"

-You still have tor and "arm" to monitor it

-Docker is pretty cool you should use it, https://www.kali.org/news/official-kali-linux-docker-images/
  also works with wifite2, it basically is a shell-oriented low-weight high-performance virtual machine
  wich can run prebuilt docker images or your personal docker images. Docs: https://docs.docker.com/

# ARCH SECTION

-Pacman commands:
  "pacman -Syy" update repositories
  "pacman -Su" update packages
  "pacman -Qdtq" list unused/orphan packages
  "pacman -R" remove a package
  "pacman -S" install a package
  "pacman -R $(pacman -Qdtq)" remove unused packages
  "pacman -Rns" remove packages and its dependencies recursively
  "pacman -Rcs" remove packages and its dependents recursively
  "pacman -Ql" list all package's files and locations
  "pacman -Qqe" list all installed packages
  "pacman -Qc" view package changelog
  "pacman -Qm" list packages not present in official repositories
  If you panic just do "sudo pacman -Syy" and then "sudo pacman -Su"
  "rm -rf /var/lib/pacman/db.lck" remove pacman's transaction lock file
    (to solve "could not unlock database" error, which happen when pacman is already running)
  NOTE: If all of a sudden everything is fucked up bad (like no GUI whatsowever)
    check the pacman log at "/var/log/pacman.log" to see what went wrong and what got removed
  To manage and download packages from the AUR use:
    pikaur: https://github.com/actionless/pikaur#installation
    yaourt (unmantained)
  These are all wrappers which means they extend some functionalities of pacman to use
    AUR, for example updating and installing packages (-Syu and -S)
  NOTE: pacman wrappers don't need to be run as root since it's dangerous to
    run PKGBUILD as such.
  Pacman GUI frontends:
    "pamac" based on gtk and it is the same GUI frontend in the gnome and KDE releases
      of manjaro, to install use the package "pamac-aur" or "pamac-aur-git" from the AUR.
    "octopi" is a lightweight GUI frontend for pacman and it is one of the most used ones
      although it isn't as visually appealing as pamac and requires a gtk sudo permission
      package such as "blank don't remember"

-Network management WIP
  Arch uses netctl to manage connections, all the config files and examples are under
    /etc/netctl/ and /etc/netctl/examples

# SYSADMIN SECTION

-"acpi" is kinda important in laptops "acpi -i" for info, also "thinkpad_acpi" should be noted

-Basic commands:
  GREP:
    G-REP or "grep" can be used to filter command results:
    "ps ax | grep whatyouwant" and it will output the line containing "whatyouwant"
    example "dmesg | grep whatyouwant"
    NOTE: "|" is used to pipe the output in another program
  PS:
    Ps is a UNIX tool used to get information about the current status of the system
    The most basic and or useful usage is to view all the running processes and the corresponding
    UUIDs (like if you want to kill process and you need its UUID), that is done by appending "ax"
    to ps: "ps ax"
  KILL:
    It kill the specified process given its UUID, syntax "kill <UUID>"
  "|" and ">":
    These are both "pipe" functions, they can pipe the output of a script or program into
    something (via std i/o), but they are used differently in the sense that "|" is specifically
    used to pipe the output into another program EX: "ps ax | grep gnome-shell", this outputs the UUIDs
    of all the gnome-shell instances since the output of "ps ax" is piped into GREP which in turn
    returns just the results of the query.
    On the other hand ">" is used to pipe the output into a file EX: "ls -la > ls.txt", this puts
    the output of ls into ls.txt which we can then read.
  "whoami" and "groups":
    they respectively output the current user and groups
    NOTE: one alternative to "whoami" is "echo $USER" which can be used in scripts
  FIND:
    Sources:
      https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-do-i-find-all-the-files-owned-by-a-particular-user-or-group/
      refer to man for all the available options
    Basic syntax:
      "find <dir> [OPTIONS]"
    OPTIONS:
      "-user <user>" find files owned by a particular user
      "-group <group>" find files owned by a particular group
      "-ls" list results in "ls" format:
      "-name <filename>" find a specific file or pattern (*.txt)

-Groups:
  Adding users to groups:
    "usermod -a -G group user"
    reboot
  Listing all groups:
    "cut -d: -f1 /etc/group | sort"

-Users:
  Creating a new user:
    useradd -m user-name
  Deleting an existing user:
    userdel user-name

-Linux afterinstall (how to get thing working):
  Bluetooth usage:
    Refers to:
      https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluetooth_headset
      https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/bluetooth
    Start the "bluetooth.service" service then refer to:
  Generating locales (languages and language support):
    Add locales uncommenting them in /etc/locale.gen
    Run "locale-gen"
    Reboot
    NOTE: if installing locales with a specific character set (russian, chinese, japanese)
      it is needed to also install the specific fonts, refer to:
      "https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Localization" to find the specific font packages
      and install them using pacman
  Getting the graphics drivers:
    For Intel graphics cards:
      Refers to: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/intel_graphics
      mesa
      lib32-mesa
      vulkan-intel
    For nvidia graphics cards:
      Please refer to: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA#Installation
    For amd graphics cards:
      mesa
      lib32-mesa
      xf86-video-ati: for Xorg hardware acceleration support
      mesa-vdpau and lib32-mesa-vdpau: for accelerated video decoding
  Adding entropy to your system:
    Refers to: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Random_number_generation
    This is useful as the kernel's built-in random number generator is very slow, as such
    it makes tasks like loading the login manager a pain.
    To solve this problem you can install some pseudo-random number generators such as:
      "rng-tools" secure, uses more CPU
      "haveged" fast and lightweight
    NOTE: Keep in mind that these are not for secure systems and remember to start and enable the service
          rngd.service
  Getting NTFS support working:
    Refers to: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NTFS-3G
    Install the "ntfs-3g" package

-Listing installed packages:
  With apt/apt-get:
    "apt list --installed"
  With pacman:
    "pacman -Qqe"

-"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd" just helpful

-To run .jar files in cli you must use "java -jar"

-To list all partitions "sudo fdisk -l"

-To check a disk's health you need "smartmontools", first check system compatibility with "sudo smartctl -c /dev/sdX"
  then either do a short test "sudo smartctl -t short /dev/sdX" or a long test "sudo smartctl -t long /dev/sdX"
  lastly do "sudo smartctl -H /dev/sdX" to get the results

-Recompiling compilers for zerynth:
  If facing compiling errors in zerynth, manually recompile the compiler for the board in ""~/.zerynth2/sys"
  for example replacing the xtensa-lx106 compiler (esp8266) goes:
    1-Move the old compiler folder somewhere safe (~/.zerynth2/sys/xtensa-lx106)
    2-Clone and compile (as standalone) new compiler in a temporary folder, guide here -> "http://domoticx.com/sdk-esp8266-xtensa-architecture-toolchain/"
    3-Move the newly created compiler folder (xtensa-lx106-elf) in ~/.zerynth2/sys and rename it as the original one (xtensa-lx106/)
    4-Copy the old package.json in the new compiler folder
  Better yet is to wait for an official fix and report the bug on the troubleshooting section
  Also the same thing has to be done with the xtensa-lx6 compiler (esp32)
  "https://dl.espressif.com/doc/esp-idf/latest/get-started/linux-setup.html"

-Various permission errors:
  Arduino permissions:
    Source: https://www.howtogeek.com/50787/add-a-user-to-a-group-or-second-group-on-linux/
    "ls -la /dev/tty*" and see which group TTYs are in, then add yourself to that group:
    "usermod -a -G examplegroup exampleusername" or just use "$USER" to add current user, then reboot.
  Wireshark permissions:
    "usermod -a -G wireshark $USER"

-Arduino not starting:
  Try installing "arduino-avr-core" package

-Theming gnome:
  download the theme packages at "https://www.gnome-look.org/" and unzip them
  then depending if it is an icon theme or an normal theme place them in
    "/usr/share/icons" or "/usr/share/themes" accordingly

-Printing documents:
  Refers to: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CUPS#Installation
  Install the "cups" package then start and enable it
  To start a print use whatever printing program you have
  NOTE: you might need to add printers and to do so, in some cases like for KDE, you'll need to be logged as root

-Adding executables and shortcuts:
  Refers to:
    https://askubuntu.com/questions/322772/how-do-i-add-an-executable-to-my-search-path
    https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3809/how-can-i-make-a-program-executable-from-everywhere
  You have to add them to your $PATH, example: "export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin"
  Quote "If you just type export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file> at the command line it will only last for the length of the session.
  If you want to change it permanently add export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file> to your ~/.bashrc file (just at the end is fine)."

-Eagle CAD dark theme fix (KDE):
  Refers to:
    https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=136316
    https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/eagle-forum/kubuntu-18-04-kde-dark-theme/td-p/8188466
  To fix this behavior you first have to apply the default light theme of KDE (breeze), then copy the kdeglobals
  file located under ~/.kde4/share/ create a folder named ~/.config_light/ and paste the kdeglobals in it,
  rename kdeglobals to config_light, then finally add to the eagle start command:
    "export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/home/ale/.config_light/ ;" (where ale is your username)
  or add an alias to the eagle command where it becomes: "export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/home/ale/.config_light/ ; eagle"
  NOTE: this will change the default settings folder to ~/.config_light, all previous setting will be lost but not
    the libraries or projects

-Use "clamav" as antivirus: "https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ClamAV", to update use "freshclam" as sudo
  and to scan "clamscan --recursive --infected /path/to/something"

-Some git stuff:
  Creating a repo and pushing the first commit: "https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/"
    basically it's a matter of defining the remote (origin) repo "git remote add origin <repo URL>"
    committing the changes in local repo "git commit -m "message" "
    pushing before first pull "git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories" the last part is just to merge the repos (if needed)
    and finally pushing the changes "git push origin master", or in atom just publish
  Using 2 factor auth. in command line and atom: "https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/"
    basically you have to use a access token instead of the password, these are unique and you can only
    see them once, so be careful with them!
  Downloading other branches:
    In your folder repo open a git bash or a terminal (for linux masterrace) then, admitted that you have already downloaded and synced the master
    branch, and type "git checkout -t origin/branchname" this will download and sync the branch

-Powertop usage:
  Arch page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/powertop
  To start powertop use "sudo powertop"
  For the first calibration use "sudo powertop --calibrate", NOTE: it takes a few minutes and during
    that time the screen may go (it does) black for a few minutes too, just let it run.
  To set everything to "good" do "sudo powertop --auto-tune",
    to make the auto-tune start at boot refer to the Arch wiki or "how to create a sysemd service"
  NOTE: in order to apply changes and stuff you have to leave it running for some time to let it
    take its measures and stuff

-Power management:
  Arch page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management#Power_management_with_systemd
  To change the actions to take when power button or lid switch events occur:
    modify the conf. file at /etc/systemd/logind.conf or /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/*.conf

-Adding executables not located in /bin/ (downloaded from internet):
  Refers to:
    https://askubuntu.com/questions/322772/how-do-i-add-an-executable-to-my-search-path
    https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3809/how-can-i-make-a-program-executable-from-everywhere
  Adding them momentarily:
    Add them to your $PATH, example: "export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin"
  Adding them at the start of the session:
      Using bashrc:
        Add export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file> (the bin/ folder) to your ~/.bashrc file (just at the end is fine)
      Using cron:
        Add export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file> to your crontab file:
          Open your crontab file using "crontab -e" for current user or "crontab -e -u username" fo others
          At the end of the file add "@reboot export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file>"
          NOTE: probably it is best do to add the command in the "su" cron file

-Checking system errors:
  Refers to:
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd#Journal
  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-journalctl-to-view-and-manipulate-systemd-logs
  If your distro users systemctl the easiest way to check errors is to look up the recent
    events in the system logs to do that type "journalctl"

-Using android devices:
  Source: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Media_Transfer_Protocol
  Android devices use the MTP interface, to be able to access them in your file manager it is usually required
    to install the packages: "libmtp" "gvfs-mtp" and "gvfs-gphoto2"
    NOTE: Apple devices require the "gvfs-afc" package, and the "gamin" package is also recommended

-File previews on KDE (Dolphin):
  Please refer to: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dolphin#File_previews
  for the list of packages suitable for different file types

-Windows:
  Adding programs to PATH:
    Source: https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/
    Open: Control panel -> system -> advanced system settings -> environment variables
    On windows 7 or 8:
      Set the variable name to "Path"
      Add the path to the program preceded by ";" ex. "...;C:\path\to\something"
    On windows 10:
      Click on "New"
      Enter the path to the program
  Retrieving the windows product key:
    Open a console with admin privileges
    Type "wmic path softwarelicensingservice get OA3xOriginalProductKey"

-Creating a systemd (systemctl) service (aka how to make a program start at boot):
  Guides and references:
  https://askubuntu.com/questions/112705/how-do-i-make-powertop-changes-permanent
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/powertop
  https://askubuntu.com/questions/919054/how-do-i-run-a-single-command-at-startup-using-systemd
  Create a file under /etc/systemd/system/ and call it <whatever>.service
  Then follow the formatting {
    [Unit]
    Description=PowerTOP auto tune

    [Service]
    Type=idle                                 # Not necessary
    Environment="TERM=dumb"                   # Not necessary
    ExecStart=PATHTOEXECUTABLE --OPTIONS

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
  }
  And then enable it using "systemctl whatever.service enable"
  Other method: using crontab
    Reference: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/cron#Crontab_format
    Install cronie then put your command into the crontab file using
      "crontab -e"
    Then follow the formatting according to the reference to specify when the command
      is executed

# LAPTOP OPTIMIZATION

-Undervolting the CPU:
  Refers to:
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Undervolting_CPU
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Stress_testing
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/benchmarking
  WARNING: Overvolting and overheating can result in permanent damage
  On arch install the package "intel-undervolt" from AUR and edit it's configuration file
  located in /etc/intel-undervolt.conf, changing the values from 0 to -number results in that
  number of millivolts taken from the CPU voltage.
  The following are the parts affected:
    "CPU" changes the CPU core voltage
    "GPU" changes the integrated GPU voltage
    "Cache" changes the cache voltage
    "System agent" changes the controller, RAM and PCI voltages
    "Analog IO" changes the various sensors voltage
  NOTE: changing the System Agent and Analog IO can lead to various errors such as inaccurate readings
    from sensors crashes and possibly corruption, so it is greatly discouraged
  One method to undervolt your CPU or GPU is to gradually step down the voltage in 5 or 10 millivolt
  steps stress testing the system in between for several minutes to ensure the system's stability
  Some tools used to stress test your system are:
    "stress" tool written in C used for memory, CPU and disk IO tests
    "mprime" AUR, tool for stress testing RAM and CPU
    "unigine-heaven" and the unigine series, although benchmarks they are a great way to stress test
      the integrated GPUs of laptops

-i915 (graphics) tweaks:
  Refers to: https://gist.github.com/Brainiarc7/aa43570f512906e882ad6cdd835efe57
  There are a number of tweaks that can save some watts regarding the integrated graphics card
  to enable them you can create a file called "/etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf" containing all of them,
  you can get the complete list of available parameters and their description by running
  "modinfo -p i915".
  The file must be filled following the format:
  options i915 "parameter"
  Some safe-to-use parameters are:
    "enable_fbc=1" enables frame buffer compression
    "enable_dc=1" enables power saving
    "disable_power_well=0" enables power well
  Other parameters may include "enable_psr=1" but that doesn't always work on pre-skylake hardware and on newer
  is straight up broken, it also depends on whether or not the display supports it, for further information refer to:
  https://hansdegoede.livejournal.com/18653.html
  NOTE: as every parameter has the potential to cause weird issues it is recommended to test them first by appending them
  to the boot command (either in GRUB, rEFInd or systemd-boot) using the syntax: i915.enable_dc=1
  After having enabled the options you can check if they were correctly applied by running "systool -m i915 -av" as root

-General tweaks:
  Use "haveged" instead of "rng-tools"
  Under KDE uninstall everything PIM or akonadi related
  Minimize the number of needed applications and daemons

# NETWORK SECTION

-Gathering information on network cards ie IP, MAC, status, etc.
  With ifconfig, just type "ifconfig" and it will give:
    ether: the MAC address
    inet: the network ip address
    netmatsk: the netmask duh
    inet6: the network ipv6
  With iwconfig (specifically for wireless cards), just type "iwconfig" and it will give:
    Mode: monitor or managed
    ESSID: the ESSID (name) of the connected network
    Frequency
    Access Point: the MAC address of the AP
    Signal level: the power/quality of the signal
    Among other informations
  Sites for public IP discovery and information gathering:
    https://www.iplocation.net/
    http://www.whatsmyip.org/

-Changing the MAC address:
  Using macchanger:
    The general usage is "macchanger [OPTIONS] interface", the most common options being
    -A for a random MAC,
    -r to reset to the original one,
    -a to change it to a random MAC of some type (same vendor),
    -b to set the "locally administered" bit set to false or
    -m XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX to manually set the MAC address.
  Using ifconfig:
    First disable the interface using "ifconfig <interface> down"
    Then change the MAC address using "ifconfig <interface> hw ether 00:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
      it has to begin with 00:*
    Then finally re-enable the interface with "ifconfig <interface> up"
  To prevent the MAC address from reverting to its original state you can configure the network manager
    to not scan for other networks using a random MAC address (that is done for security by many OSs and
    also by phones), to achieve this you have to change the conf. file for your network manager:
      For GNOME (kali) add {
        [device]
        wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=preserve

        [connection]
        ethernet.cloned-mac-address=preserve
        wifi.cloned-mac-address=preserve
      }
      to /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

-Changing interfaces to monitor mode:
  Not mandatory but best use is to first use "airmon-ng check kill", this kills all processes
    that could interfere with the process and later with the attacks
  Using airmon-ng:
    Simply use "airmon-ng start <interface>" to put it in monitor mode
    And "airmon-ng stop <interface>" to revert it to managed
  NOTE: when using airmon-ng it will change the interface name by adding *mon to its name
    for example wlan0 becomes wlan0mon
  Using iwconfig (useful since first method is not always reliable):
    Disable interface using "ifconfig <interface> down" or "ifdown <interface>"
    Change to monitor mode with "iwconfig <interface> mode monitor"
    Re-enable interface with "ifconfig <interface> up" or "ifup <interface>"
    To revert it back to managed disable the interface then do "iwconfig <interface> mode managed"
      then re-enable the interface

-Restarting network interfaces:
  Without ssh:
    Disable and re-enable the interface with "ifdown <interface>" and then "ifup <interface>"
      or "ifconfig <interface> down" and then "ifconfig <interface> up"
  On ssh:
    Non systemd "/etc/init.d/networking restart"
    Systemd (Arch) "systemctl restart NetworkManager"

-Enabling IP forwarding:
  Arch page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Internet_sharing
  "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
  To revert it back:
    "echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"

# USEFUL PROGRAMS

  -"youtube-dl" is a tool that allows you to download content (eg. videos, audio and thumbnails)
    from not only youtube but also from other streaming sites

  -"firejail" is a program used to isolate other programs in a sandbox to make their execution
    more secure, giving them minimal access to the system files

  -"ms-office-online" (AUR) the online office suite for 'offline' use
    NOTE: needs registration to the Microsoft services

  -"maybe" lets you see what a certain command does before it does it, ex "maybe rm -rf /home" lets you see which files will be affected
    by rm.
    NOTE: this is a python script, to install it use "sudo pip install maybe", the "python-pip" package is required
