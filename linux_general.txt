-Qt for wayland requires qt5-wayland package and "export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland"

-"https://www.iplocation.net/" is pretty useful

-Changing the MAC address:
  Using macchanger:
    The general usage is "macchanger [OPTIONS] interface", the most common options being
    -A for a random MAC,
    -r to reset to the original one,
    -a to change it to a random MAC of some type (same vendor),
    -b to set the "locally administered" bit set to false or
    -m XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX to manually set the MAC address.
  Using ifconfig:
    First disable the interface using "ifconfig <interface> down"
    Then change the MAC address using "ifconfig <interface> hw ether 00:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
      it has to begin with 00:*
    Then finally re-enable the interface with "ifconfig <interface> up"

-Wifite2 works much better than wifite "https://github.com/derv82/wifite2"

-The network interfaces are named "wlp3s0" for the internal one and "wlp0s20u2" for the alpha networks msfconsole

-Do not panic use the WiGLE maps to discover wifis for later use ;)

-You still have tor and "arm" to monitor it

-IP forwarding:

    thank me later

-Docker is pretty cool you should use it, https://www.kali.org/news/official-kali-linux-docker-images/
  also works with wifite2, it basically is a shell-oriented low-weight high-performance virtual machine
  wich can run prebuilt docker images or your personal docker images. Docs: https://docs.docker.com/

-Pacman commands:
  "pacman -Syy" update repositories
  "pacman -Su" update packages
  "pacman -Qdtq" list unused/orphan packages
  "pacman -R" remove a package
  "pacman -S" install a package
  "pacman -R $(pacman -Qdtq)" remove unused packages
  "pacman -Rns" remove packages and its dependencies (recursively)
  "pacman -Ql" list all package files and locations
  "pacman -Qqe" list all installed packages
  If you panic just do "sudo pacman -Syy" and then "sudo pacman -Su"
  "rm -rf /var/lib/pacman/db.lck" remove pacman's transaction lock file
    (to solve "could not unlock database" error)

-"acpi" is kinda important in laptops "acpi -i" for info, also "thinkpad_acpi" should be noted

-GREP basics:
  GREP or "grep" is the most beautiful thing in the fucking universe, use it to filter results like:
  "ps ax | grep whatyouwant" and it will find it another example is "dmesg | grep whatyouwant"
  the | is used to pipe the output in another program like, can you guess it? grep

-You use "ps ax" to view all processes and their UIDs

-"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd" just helpful

-Remember: the ArchLinux wiki is your lord and savior

-Bluetooth usage:
  Start the "bluetooth.service" service then refer to:

-You have a one year subscription to PIA

-Kismet requires to be started with "kismet -c ifacemon" where ifacemon is your interface in monitor mode

-Surface programs: Leonardo (drawing), Dolby access (you payed for it)

-Remember that you have a GL-AR150 mini router with tor, openvpn support and that it is based on openwrt, also:

-Make some bash scripts you idiot, oh and this could be useful http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Type%20Something%20

-Upon installing linux, to add locales uncomment them in /etc/locale.gen and then run "locale-gen" as sudo
  to search for fonts just open https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Localization
  Note that you need japanese and chinese locales and fonts to display those characters correctly

-Install "mesa", "lib32-mesa" and "vulkan-intel" for the graphics you dumb fuck
  "https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/intel_graphics"

-To run .jar files in cli you must use "java -jar"

-To list all partitions "sudo fdisk -l"

-To check a disk's health you need "smartmontools", first check system compatibility with "sudo smartctl -c /dev/sdX"
  then either do a short test "sudo smartctl -t short /dev/sdX" or a long test "sudo smartctl -t long /dev/sdX"
  lastly do "sudo smartctl -H /dev/sdX" to get the results

-Problem with xtensa-lx106 gcc for compiling esp8266 programs:
 "https://community.zerynth.com/t/can-not-build-wifi-example-on-nodemcu-v3-error-building-native-c-driver/1280"



-Recompiling compilers for zerynth:
  If facing compiling errors in zerynth, manually recompile the compiler for the board in ""~/.zerynth2/sys"
  for example replacing the xtensa-lx106 compiler (esp8266) goes:
    1-Move the old compiler folder somewhere safe (~/.zerynth2/sys/xtensa-lx106)
    2-Clone and compile (as standalone) new compiler in a temporary folder, guide here -> "http://domoticx.com/sdk-esp8266-xtensa-architecture-toolchain/"
    3-Move the newly created compiler folder (xtensa-lx106-elf) in ~/.zerynth2/sys and rename it as the original one (xtensa-lx106/)
    4-Copy the old package.json in the new compiler folder
  Better yet is to wait for an official fix and report the bug on the troubleshooting section
  Also the same thing has to be done with the xtensa-lx6 compiler (esp32)

-Pay attention of those sneaky KDE bastards, mostly everything which begins with k is EVIL

-Fixing Arduino permissions:
  Source: https://www.howtogeek.com/50787/add-a-user-to-a-group-or-second-group-on-linux/
  "ls -la /dev/tty*" and see which group TTYs are in, then add yourself to that group:
  "usermod -a -G examplegroup exampleusername" or just use "$USER" to add current user, then reboot.

-Theming gnome:
  download the theme packages at "https://www.gnome-look.org/" and unzip them
  then depending if it is an icon theme or an normal theme place them in
    "/usr/share/icons" or "/usr/share/themes" accordingly

-Adding executables and shortcuts:
  Refers to:
    https://askubuntu.com/questions/322772/how-do-i-add-an-executable-to-my-search-path
    https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3809/how-can-i-make-a-program-executable-from-everywhere
  You have to add them to your $PATH, example: "export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin"
  Quote "If you just type export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file> at the command line it will only last for the length of the session.
  If you want to change it permanently add export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file> to your ~/.bashrc file (just at the end is fine)."

-Use "clamav" as antivirus: "https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ClamAV", to update use "freshclam" as sudo
  and to scan "clamscan --recursive --infected /path/to/something"

-If by nay chance you need a key's datasheet, like for copying it with just a photo (more on that later ;),

-Some git stuff:
  Creating a repo and pushing the first commit: "https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/"
    basically it's a matter of defining the remote (origin) repo "git remote add origin <repo URL>"
    committing the changes in local repo "git commit -m "message" "
    pushing before first pull "git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories" the last part is just to merge the repos (if needed)
    and finally pushing the changes "git push origin master", or in atom just publish
  Using 2 factor auth. in command line and atom: "https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/"
    basically you have to use a access token instead of the password, these are unique and you can only
    see them once, so be careful with them!

-Powertop usage:
  Arch page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/powertop
  To start powertop use "sudo powertop"
  For the first calibration use "sudo powertop --calibrate", note that it takes a few minutes and during
    that time the screen may go (it does) black for a few minutes too, just let it run.
  To set everything to "good" do "sudo powertop --auto-tune",
    to make the auto-tune start at boot refer to the Arch wiki or "how to create a sysemd service"
  Note that in order to apply changes and stuff you have to leave it running for some time to let it
    take its measures and stuff

-Power management:
  Arch page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management#Power_management_with_systemd
  To change the actions to take when power button or lid switch events occur:
    modify the conf. file at /etc/systemd/logind.conf or /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/*.conf


-To get the windows product key execute with admin privileges: wmic path softwarelicensingservice get OA3xOriginalProductKey

-Use mitmf or ettercap to start mitm then use ferret to capture cookies (ferret -i eth0)
  use hamster to set session cookies and then in browser set the proxy settings to manual giving the address
  provided by hamster and finally open that link

-Example usage of mitmf: sudo mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 192.168.1.1 --target 192.168.1.10 -i wlan0

-IP forwarding: "https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Internet_sharing_(Italiano)" more precisely:
    "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward" thank me later

-To restart network interfaces: "ifdown <interface>" "ifup <interface>" "/etc/init.d/networking restart"
    (tested working on Ubuntu server and Debian)

-If airmon-ng doesn't work use "ifconfig <inerface> down" then "iwconfig <interface> mode monitor" and finally
  "ifconfig <interface> up"

-To note that "iwconfig" and "ifconfig" are basically equivalent, iwconfig can be used as "iwconfig <interface>"
  to mask just one interface and it gives more information like the status and mode (managed, monitor)

-Who are you? "whoami"

-Where am I? "groups"

-To add executables you have to add them to your $PATH, example: "export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin"
  "https://askubuntu.com/questions/322772/how-do-i-add-an-executable-to-my-search-path"
  or from "https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3809/how-can-i-make-a-program-executable-from-everywhere"
  quote "If you just type export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file> at the command line it will only last for the length of the session.
  If you want to change it permanently add export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file> (the bin/ folder) to your ~/.bashrc file (just at the end is fine)."

-To check system logs use "journalctl" (you must have systemctl), some guides:
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd#Journal
  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-journalctl-to-view-and-manipulate-systemd-logs

-https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/


-To create a systemd (systemctl) service (aka how to make a program start at boot):
  create a file under /etc/systemd/system/ and call it <whatever>.service
  then follow the formatting {
    [Unit]
    Description=PowerTOP auto tune

    [Service]
    Type=idle                                 # Not necessary
    Environment="TERM=dumb"                   # Not necessary
    ExecStart="PATHTOEXECUTABLE --OPTIONS"

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
  }
  And then enable it using "systemctl whatever.service enable", here are some guides and references:
